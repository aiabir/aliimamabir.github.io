## Professional Projects

* **Biscom Cloud and On-prem Secure File Transfer™:**  Both on-prem and cloud solutions support simple, secure, and fast file transfer – it all depends on organization needs. For extremely large terabyte-size files and automation utilities, with granular administrative control and configuration, choose Biscom On-prem Secure File Transfer. For fast adoption, broad support for all browsers and mobile devices as a pure SaaS offering and no software on-site, Biscom Cloud SFT may be a better fit. Either way, they provide e end-to-end security with FIPS 140-2 certified encryption at rest, full tracking and reporting, and notifications when messages and files are opened and downloaded.
